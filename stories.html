      <p>“I’ve been selling Kulfi at this beach for 11 hours, everyday since the past 20 years. My kulfi is evergreen -- rain, hail or sunshine, no one can refuse a Kulfi! That’s the charm of this city, but it can also make you feel homesick! My wife and children live in Pune and I can only afford to visit them twice a month. I describe the beach and twinkling skyline to them whenever I go home. I tell them of all the famous people I’ve seen and the friends I’ve made. They look in wonder, but for me, the whole world is in that room with them -- my wife and children huddled around me. By the way, I should tell you that my wife is the most beautiful woman in the world and her smile...my God! It reminds me of a perfect sunset by the beach -- warm waters, pink skies and a malai kulfi in hand!”

        <p >“I grew up in a chawl on Mohammad Ali Road. The girls who I grew up with would get married by the time they were 15 & by college they’d have their 1st child. I was 1 of the few who went on to do something ‘abnormal’ by continuing school. While neighbours used to say things like ‘what’s the point of studying! Learn cooking instead!’ or ‘if you keep working, when will you get married?’, my mom was firm about getting me educated–she wanted me to make something of myself. She wasn’t working & she didn’t want that for me. My brothers supported me too when this came up.
        Still, it wasn’t easy–when my mom fell ill, it was assumed that I would stay at home to look after her, while my brothers would go out to work. I’m not complaining–I would do anything for my mom, but why is it always the woman’s role? I didn’t understand it. I got a flexible job as a teacher so that I could take care of her. In college, I realised that there were women out there with real opportunities–I realised that life could be different from my reality–so I started preparing for my MBA secretly. During this time, my mom passed away, but somehow her death inspired me to push harder to change things...for myself and others. I managed to get a scholarship for my MBA– 1 year in, I founded a start-up which focused on women’s literacy.
        The more I worked with these girls, the more I realised that I could’ve been them–most of them had no option to study, others had to take permission from a male figure to go to a doctor & some had to give up their education to take care of their siblings.
        In 2017, I got a full scholarship and stipend from the University of Oxford. I got a degree in Women’s Studies & even though I got job opportunities abroad, I came home–ready to make a change.
        I’ve worked with daughters of sex workers & girls from low income backgrounds. We’ve tried to enable change through things like feeling comfortable wearing shorts while playing football or finding a middle ground between home & school. I’m now working on encouraging companies to invest in women. I know change won’t happen overnight, but we must try & try hard–equality IS progress for the country, something we must never forget."

But we were trying our best – our city needed us. Still, we were exhausted. At night, I suddenly saw packets of food and water being passed through the barricade -- they were for us! It wasn’t just chips or biscuits -- the people saw that we were working for long hours without a break and cooked home food for us. There was terror all around us, but still -- the love in our hearts prevailed. I was proud to call Bombay my home that day.”

Hopefully, I’ll be able to collect enough money, but apart from just going to a good college, I hope my efforts teach her how important money is...and how she needs to make something of herself without depending on anyone else.”

        <p>“I’m only a tenth-pass. I’ve always done odd jobs. Eventually I became a watchman and I’ve been doing this for over 20 years. One thing I know is that no matter how much you study, education isn’t always enough to guarantee you a job. I’ve even seen the educated jobless. So I’ve given my kids one piece of advice that I’ll tell you also -- go to college, but also enjoy your life before you start working. Don’t give so much ‘bhaav’ to studying. Yes, It’s an investment but the future is still uncertain. So why not have a little fun?”

When I train, the little girls in the area observe me. They’re so fascinated, that they even bring their mothers along with them!
One of the girls told my coach that I was her hero and she wanted to learn kickboxing as well. That’s the day I felt like I achieved something. I empowered a little girl, and there’s nothing on earth that can compare to that feeling!”</p>

I have been talking to my parents about moving abroad to study further. My father is a complete tough love kind of person and that’s how it’s always been between us. We adore each other but we don’t talk about it.
Recently, my mom told me over the phone, that the other night, he said he was worried about me leaving and that if I end up going, he’s really going to miss me. I didn’t get to hear him say it or watch this happen face to face, but it doesn’t matter...it's made me feel closer to him."</p>
